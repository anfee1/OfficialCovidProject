# OfficialCovidProject
This was my senior project which was done to prove my abilities as a software engineer at Morgan State University.

This project used Android Studio to create a mobile vaccine passport. I used the very basic Text Input widgets to allow me to ask the user for simple form information.

I then used a Google Script to control my login and most of the other functionality on the app which allows me to autheniticate and allow users to see their vaccine information.

The hardest part of the project would need to be making the picture into a string bitmap so that the computer could parse it in a json file.

Another difficult part of the project was finding a way to keep track of the user on the frontend and backend so that the data would make sense on both sides.
This really just required me to pass attributes through each screen of the app so that there was a reference to who each user was.

To explain the server side would be pretty difficult, but luckily everything from the backend to the frontend will be within this github.
Hopefully there's no issues but if there is don't be afraid to email me for any questions.
